          <h2>ORDER CHANGES</h2>
          <p>
            At VCD we understand that it can be difficult for our customers to
            envision what their 3D renderings and visualizations will look like
            the first time. We encourage you to take your time and review the
            first 3D rendering we send you. You are welcome to mark it up with
            any changes you’d like to see and provide feedback.  Please include
            as much detail as possible in your markups so that the second
            rendering we send you is perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first mark up is included in the price. All other changes will
            be charged additionally on a case by case basis depending on your
            requirements. It is why it is very important that you send us as
            much information as possible before project starts.
